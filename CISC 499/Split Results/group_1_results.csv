### Sample Input and Execution

To demonstrate the script's execution, you can run the script and provide the following input when prompted:

```
Enter an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s separated by spaces: 2 0 1 2 1 0 0 2 1
```

The output will be:

```
Sorted array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
```

This script efficiently sorts the array using a linear time complexity algorithm, ensuring that all 0s are at the beginning, followed by 1s, and all 2s at the end.",dutch_national_flag_problem.py,27

unique = ''
for c in s:
    if c not in unique:
        unique += c
print(""Number of unique characters:"", len(unique))","This Python script prompts the user to input a string and then calculates the number of unique characters present in that string. The script initializes an empty string `unique` to store characters that have not been encountered before. It iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`, checking if `c` is not already in `unique`. If `c` is not present, it appends `c` to `unique`. After processing all characters, the script prints the count of unique characters by outputting the length of the `unique` string. This approach effectively filters out duplicate characters, ensuring each character is counted only once.","Here is a Python script that implements the described functionality:

```python
def count_unique_characters():
    # Prompt the user to input a string
    s = input(""Enter a string: "")
    
    # Initialize an empty string to store unique characters
    unique = """"
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for c in s:
        # Check if the character is not already in the unique string
        if c not in unique:
            # Append the character to the unique string
            unique += c
    
    # Print the count of unique characters
    print(""Number of unique characters:"", len(unique))

# Call the function to execute the script
count_unique_characters()
```

### Sample Input and Execution:

```
Enter a string: hello world
Number of unique characters: 8
```

In this example, the input string ""hello world"" contains the unique characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd', resulting in a count of 8 unique characters.",countUniqueChars.py,30

","This Python script implements a simple feedforward neural network with backpropagation for training. It defines several classes: `Layer` for representing a neural network layer with weights and biases, `Activation` for activation functions and their gradients (ReLU and Sigmoid), `Loss` for calculating mean squared error and its gradient, and `Optimizer` for updating weights and biases using gradient descent. The `NeuralNetwork` class orchestrates the forward and backward propagation steps. During the forward step, it computes the output of each layer using the specified activation functions. In the backward step, it calculates gradients for weights and biases using the chain rule and updates them to minimize the loss. The network is trained over a specified number of epochs, printing the loss at each epoch.

### Sample Input and Execution:

1. The program starts and prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 200.
2. The user enters a guess, for example, `50`.
3. The program responds with ""Too low!"" if the hidden number is higher than 50.
4. The user continues guessing, for example, `150`.
5. The program responds with ""Too high!"" if the hidden number is lower than 150.
6. The user eventually guesses the correct number, for example, `123`.
7. The program outputs ""Hit! You've guessed the correct number!"" and exits the loop.
8. If at any point the user enters `x`, the program outputs ""Thank you for playing! Goodbye!"" and terminates.",numberGuessing.py,16

twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
","The provided Python script defines a function `twoSum` that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target` as its parameters. The purpose of the function is to find two distinct indices in the list such that the numbers at these indices add up to the specified `target`. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of indices in the list. For each pair, it checks if the sum of the numbers at these indices equals the `target`. If a matching pair is found, it prints the indices as a list. The function is then called with the list `[2, 7, 11, 15]` and the target `9`, which results in printing `[0, 1]` because the numbers at indices 0 and 1 (2 and 7) add up to 9. The function does not return any value explicitly, as indicated by the empty list at the end.","Here's a Python script that implements the described functionality:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Iterate over all possible pairs of indices
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            # Check if the sum of the numbers at these indices equals the target
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                # Print the indices as a list
                print([i, j])

# Sample input
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]

# Call the function with the sample input

### Sample Input and Execution

","The provided Python script calculates the minimum edit distance between two input strings, which is a measure of how dissimilar the strings are by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

","The provided Python script is designed to solve the ""Disk Stacking"" problem, where the goal is to stack a set of disks to achieve the maximum possible height. Each disk is represented by a list of three integers: width, depth, and height. The script first sorts the disks based on their height. It then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum stack height by iterating through each disk and checking if it can be placed on top of any previously considered disk, based on the condition that the width, depth, and height of the current disk must be greater than those of the disk below it. The script maintains an array of heights to track the maximum height achievable with each disk as the topmost disk and a sequences array to reconstruct the sequence of disks that form the tallest stack. Finally, it identifies the sequence of disks that results in the maximum stack height and prints this sequence. The script includes a user input section where the user can input the dimensions of the disks, and it outputs the optimal stacking sequence.","Below is a Python script that implements the described functionality for solving the ""Disk Stacking"" problem.
